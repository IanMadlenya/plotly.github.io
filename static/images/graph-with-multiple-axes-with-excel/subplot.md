   sub-steps:

 - title: Select Your Subplot
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Once you've opened your workspace here:https://plot.ly/alpha/workspace/, add your data and choose your chart type. Click on GRAPH on the left-hand side to add the values to your plot by filling out the X and Y dropdown to create the plot.
Once you've added your first trace, click the blue '+Trace' button on the right-hands side of the panel to add another. Once that new trace tab opens, click on 'Subplot and Multiple Axes'.
This will open a section where you can select an arrangement for your subplot. This arrangement is specifically for that trace. You can have them stacked, side-by-side, or as an inset. Choose one and click CONFIRM.
Then repeat until you have all your desired values on your plot. Play around with you plot until you get it the way you want."
