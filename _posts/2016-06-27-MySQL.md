    - copy: "NOTE: If you are running your database locally, the *server* input field can stay empty since its default value is 'localhost'. Similarly, if your database is setup on port number *3306*, you may leave the *port* input field empty as well. If your database is setup on a remote server, simply copy the endpoint name into the *server* input field and enter the remote server's port number on which your database is located."

You may come back to change this entry, if you want to query from or simply preview a different database. There is no need to disconnect before switching databases."
