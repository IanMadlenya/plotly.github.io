#Graph With a Subplot

<div>
    <a href="https://plot.ly/~Dreamshot/404/" target="_blank" title="Photon Density vs. Photon Energy" style="display: block; text-align: center;"><img src="https://plot.ly/~Dreamshot/404.png" alt="Photon Density vs. Photon Energy" style="max-width: 100%;width: 600px;"  width="600" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';" /></a>
    <script data-plotly="Dreamshot:404" src="https://plot.ly/embed.js" async></script>
</div>

Follow along below to make a chart with a subplot.

### Step 1 - Upload your Excel data to Plotly's grid

Open the data file for this tutorial in Excel. You can download the file here in <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/subplot.csv">CSV</a>
format.

### Step 2 - Head to Plotly

Head to Plotly's Workspace at <a class="link--impt" href="/plot">https://plot.ly/plot</a> and sign into your free 
Plotly account. Go to "Import," click "Upload a file," then choose your Excel file to upload. Your Excel file will 
now open in Plotly's grid. For more about Plotly's grid, see the tutorial: <a class="link--impt" 
href="/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/">https://plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/</a>

### Step 3 - Creating Your Chart

Label your columns like we did below. You'll have three different x-y datasets (margin of error, photon density/energy,
electron energy/density). Select “Line plots” from the MAKE A PLOT menu and then click line plot in the bottom left.

Your plot would initially look something like this.
