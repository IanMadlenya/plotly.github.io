 - title: Upload your Excel data to Plotly's grid
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Open the data file for this tutorial in Excel. You can download the file here in [CSV format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/2014_us_cities.csv)"

 - title: Head to Plotly
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Head to [Plotly's Workspace](https://plot.ly/plot) and sign into your free Plotly account. Go to 'Import', click 'Upload a file', then choose your Excel file to upload. Your Excel file will now open in Plotly's grid. For more about Plotly's grid, see [this tutorial](help.plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/)"

 - title: Creating Your Chart
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Head to the 'MAKE A PLOT' dropdown and select 'Bubble map.' Label your columns like we did below. You'll have a column for latitude and longitude. Then, click both the 'Size By' and 'Text' options on the left; assign 'Text' to the city and 'Size By' to the population. For ideal bubble sizing on your final chart, organize the cities by population (separate top 2, then 3-10, 11-20, 21-50 and 50-3000)."

    - copy: "Since our data only encompasses the U.S., we can change the map layout to focus on the Lower 48, Alaska and Hawaii. Head to the LAYOUT popover, then select the 'Geo layout' option and select 'USA' within the scope dropdown."

    - copy: "We suggest changing your 'Bubble Scale' for each trace to enhance the visual appeal. Head to the TRACES popover, then the 'Style' menu. For 'trace 0 [0-2],' use an area of 200. 'Trace 1 [3-10]' should have an area of 500, then 1000 for 'trace 3 [11-20],' 2000 for 'trace 4 [21-50],' and 3000 for 'trace 5 [50-3000].'"

    - copy: "When finished scaling, your plot should look something like this."

    - copy: "Our legend describes the traces. Remember, we sorted the cities by population earlier. Label your traces accordingly."

Download an image of your Plotly graph by clicking EXPORT on the toolbar."
      img: "![Export](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plotly-tutorials/excel/bubble-maps/export-bubble-map.png)"
