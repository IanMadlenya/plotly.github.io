# Adding new Excel charting tutorials

## Some tips:

- The date in the prefix of the post title sets the order of the post. Tutorials with later dates are listed earlier.
- The template system hates quotes within quotes. Make sure to use single quotes within double quote. "This "quote" will not work". But "This 'quote' will work."
- Use images.plot.ly for adding new images. Log-in here: https://661924842005.signin.aws.amazon.com/console Username is Plotly_Editors
