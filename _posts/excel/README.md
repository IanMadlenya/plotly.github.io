# Adding new Excel charting tutorials

## Guidelines:

1. The date in the prefix of the post title sets the order of the post. Tutorials with later dates are listed earlier.

2. The template system hates quotes within quotes. Make sure to use single quotes within double quote. "This "quote" will not work". But "This 'quote' will work."

3. Use images.plot.ly for adding new images. Log-in here: https://661924842005.signin.aws.amazon.com/console Username is Plotly_Editors.

4. DON'T ADD CAROUSEL IMAGES FOR NEW POSTS.

5. URLs SHOULD MATCH THE URLs FOR THE PYTHON DOCS: https://plot.ly/python/. For example:
  - Because the URL for Python line charts is: https://plot.ly/python/line-charts/
  - The URL for Excel line charts would then be: http://help.plot.ly/excel/line-charts

6. MAKE SURE TEXT IN IMAGES THAT YOU UPLOAD IS NOT FUZZY. If anything in the image is fuzzy, take a new screenshot and try again.
 
7. Chart section anchors should also MATCH THE PYTHON DOCS. 
  - For example https://plot.ly/python/#3d
  - Would then make the 3d section on the Excel homepage help.plot.ly/excel/#3d

8. All datasets for download should be on Plotly's dataset repo: https://github.com/plotly/datasets

9. All "Open Data in Plotly" links should link to the dataset AS A PUBLIC GRID WITHIN PLOTLY'S WORKSPACE. IE, https://plot.ly/15022/~jackp/ 

10. Partial screenshots of an interesting part of the chart are usually better thumbnails that trying to screenshot the entire thing.
