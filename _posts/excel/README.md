# Adding new Excel charting tutorials

## Some tips:

- The date in the prefix of the post title sets the order of the post. Tutorials with later dates are listed earlier.
- The template system hates quotes within quotes. Make sure to use single quotes within double quote. "This "quote" will not work". But "This 'quote' will work."
- Use images.plot.ly for adding new images. Log-in here: https://661924842005.signin.aws.amazon.com/console Username is Plotly_Editors.
- DON'T ADD CAROUSEL IMAGES FOR NEW POSTS.
- URLs SHOULD MATCH THE URLs FOR THE PYTHON DOCS: https://plot.ly/python/. For example:
  - Because the URL for Python line charts is: https://plot.ly/python/line-charts/
  - The URL for Excel line charts would then be: http://help.plot.ly/excel/line-charts
- MAKE SURE TEXT IN IMAGES THAT YOU UPLOAD IS NOT FUZZY. If anything in the image is fuzzy, take a new screenshot and try again.
