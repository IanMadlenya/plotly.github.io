    - copy: "Enter your username, password, database server name and its port number. Lastly, enter an initial database to which you want to connect, you may change it once your credentials have been accepted. In this case we are connecting to *plotly_datasets*."
    - copy: "Have no database? Try it out with our read-only MariaDB. Copy *readonly-test-postgres.cwwxgcilxwxw.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com* into the *server* input field and use *masteruser* and *connecttoplotly* as username and password respectively."
    - copy: "NOTE: If you are running your database locally, the *server* input field can stay empty since its default value is 'localhost'. Similarly, if your database is setup on port number *5432*, you may leave the *port* input field empty as well. If your database is setup on a remote server, simply copy the endpoint name into the *server* input field and enter the remote server's port number on which your database is located."
    - copy: "Finally, click on the *connect* button!"
 - title: Choose A Database

    - copy: "Click on the dropdown menu and select the database that you wish to use in order to connect to it and query data from it. In this case we have alrady established connection to *plotly_datasets* and do not need to change it further. Later, you may come back to change this entry, if you want to query from or simply preview a different database. There is no need to disconnect before switching databases."
