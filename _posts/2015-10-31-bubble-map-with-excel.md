Follow along below to make a buuble map of your own.

### Step 1 - Upload your Excel data to Plotly's grid

Open the data file for this tutorial in Excel. You can download the file here in 
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/2014_us_cities.csv">CSV</a>
format.

### Step 2 - Head to Plotly
      
Head to Plotly's Workspace at <a class="link--impt" href="/plot">https://plot.ly/plot</a> and sign into your free 
Plotly account. Go to "Import," click "Upload a file," then choose your Excel file to upload. Your Excel file will 
now open in Plotly's grid. For more about Plotly's grid, see the tutorial: <a class="link--impt"

### Step 3 - Creating Your Chart

Label your columns like we did below. You'll have a column for latitude and longitude. Then, click both the 
"Size By" and "Text" options on the left; assign "Text" to the city and "Size By" to the population. 

Select “Bubble map” from the MAKE A PLOT menu and then click bubble map in the bottom left.
