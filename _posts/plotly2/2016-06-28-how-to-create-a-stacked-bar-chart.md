 - title: Format Your Data
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Choose your 'Chart Type' in the GRAPH section on the left-hand side and select 'Bar chart'."
      img: "![Choose chart main](../static/images/bar-graph/choose-chart-main.png)"

 - title: Add Your Data to Plotly
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Head to Plotly’s Workspace and add your data. You have the option of typing directly in the grid, uploading your file, or entering a URL of an online dataset. Plotly accepts .xls, .xlsx, or .csv files. For more information on how to enter your data, see [this](http://help.plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/) tutorial."
      img: "![Import data main](../static/images/bar-graph/import-data-main.png)"
    - copy: "After selecting 'Bar chart' under 'Chart Type', you can check out an example before adding your own data. Clicking the 'try an example' button will show what a sample chart looks like after adding data and playing with the style. You'll also see what labels were selected for this specific chart, as well as the end result."

 - title: Create a Chart
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "After adding your own data, click on GRAPH on the left-hand side to add your Y- axis and X-axis to your stacked bar chart. After selecting ‘Bar chart', you're then presented the y-axis and x-axis as shown in the figure below to create the plot."
      img: "![Adding x and y axis](../static/images/bar-graph/adding-x-and-y-axis.png)"
    - copy: "This will create a raw stacked chart, as seen below."
      img: "![Adding x and y axis](../static/images/bar-graph/raw-stacked-chart.png)"
    - copy: "For charts that have many values such as this one, we need to add more data on the x-axis. We do this by clicking on the 'Trace' button at the top right-hand side of that pane."
      img: "![Trace open](../static/images/bar-graph/trace-opened.png)"
    - copy: " You can add as many traces as you need, until your plot is complete!"
      img: "![Finished traces](../static/images/bar-graph/finished-traces.png)"

 - title: Style a Chart
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "You can choose your colours, text position, or typeface. Click on STYLE on the left-hand side to play around with the style of your chart."
    - copy: "To make this bar chart a stacked bar chart, visit the 'Traces' section under STYLE and select the 'Stacked' option under 'Bars'. Your chart will now be updated."
      img: "![Stacked chart](../static/images/bar-graph/stacked-chart.png)"
    - copy: "To change the colours, click on ‘Traces’ under the same STYLE tab. Note that certain colours and typeface are available only on PRO. Click [here](https://plot.ly/products/cloud/) to upgrade!"
      img: "![Colour main](../static/images/create-pie-chart/colour-main.png)"
    - copy: "To add a title to your plot, you can type it directly on the title by double-clicking it. The same can be done for the axis labels, and legend."
      img: "![Type directly](../static/images/bar-graph/type-directly-on-title.png)"
      img: "![Type directly](../static/images/bar-graph/axis-labels.png)"
      img: "![Type directly](../static/images/bar-graph/legend-titles.png)"
    - copy: "Another option is to visit the 'Traces' section under STYLE, click on 'Text' and enter your title in the box, as shown below."
      img: "![Type in layout panel](../static/images/bar-graph/type-in-layout-panel.png)"

 - title: Save and Share
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Your chart is now done! Click SAVE on the left-hand side, and give your file a name."
      img: "![Save main](../static/images/bar-graph/save-main-screen.png)"
    - copy: "Select your PLOT and DATA as 'Public' or 'Private'."
      img: "![Save pop-up](../static/images/bar-graph/save-pop-up.png)"
