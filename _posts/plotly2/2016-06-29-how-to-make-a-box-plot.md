steps: 
 - title: Format Your Data
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Choose your 'Chart Type' in the GRAPH section on the left-hand side and select 'Box plot'. This is a PRO feature, meaning that you can create this chart but you won't be able to save it unless you [upgrade](https://plot.ly/products/cloud/)."
      img: "![Choose chart main](../static/images/box-plot/choose-chart-type.png)"

 - title: Add Your Data to Plotly
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Head to Plotly’s Workspace and add your data. You have the option of typing directly in the grid, uploading your file, or entering a URL of an online dataset. Plotly accepts .xls, .xlsx, or .csv files. For more information on how to enter your data, see [this](http://help.plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/) tutorial."
      img: "![Import data main](../static/images/box-plot/import-data.png)"
    - copy: "After selecting 'Box plot' under 'Chart Type', you can check out an example before adding your own data. Clicking the 'try an example' button will show what a sample chart looks like after adding data and playing with the style. You'll also see what values were selected for this specific chart, as well as the end result."
      img: "![Example after](../static/images/box-plot/try-an-example.png)"

 - title: Create a Chart
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "After adding your own data, click on GRAPH on the left-hand side to add your values to your boxed plot. After selecting ‘Box plot', you're then presented the 'Values' and 'X-Data' (as shown in the figure below) to create the plot."
      img: "![Values](../static/images/box-plot/Values.png)"
    - copy: "This will create a raw plot, as seen below. Don't worry, it still needs more work to get it the way you want!"
      img: "![Raw plot](../static/images/box-plot/raw-plot.png)"
    - copy: "For charts that have many values such as this one, we need to add more data in 'Values'. We do this by clicking on the 'Trace' button at the top rigth-hand side of that pane."
      img: "![Trace open](../static/images/box-plot/traces.png)"
    - copy: " You can add as many traces as you need, until your plot is complete!"
      img: "![Finished traces](../static/images/box-plot/finish-traces.png)"

 - title: Style a Chart
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "You can choose your colours, text position, or typeface. Click on STYLE on the left-hand side to play around with the style of your chart."
    - copy: "To change the colours of your boxes, select ‘Traces’ under the same STYLE tab, then click on FILL and a colour pop-up will appear. As you scroll down that pane, each box will have its own FILL colour that you can change. Note that certain colours and typeface are available only on PRO. Click [here](https://plot.ly/products/cloud/) to upgrade!"
      img: "![Colour fill](../static/images/box-plot/fill-colour.png)"
    - copy: "To add a title to your plot, you can type it directly on the title by double-clicking it. The same can be done for the axis labels, and legend."
      img: "![Type directly](../static/images/box-plot/type-directly.png)"
      img: "![Type directly](../static/images/box-plot/legend.png)"
      img: "![Type directly](../static/images/box-plot/axes-label.png)"
    - copy: "Another option is to visit the 'Traces' section under STYLE, click on 'Text' and enter your title in the box, as shown below."
      img: "![Type in layout panel](../static/images/box-plot/type-directly-in-panel.png)"

 - title: Save and Share
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Your chart is now done! Click SAVE on the left-hand side, and give your file a name."
      img: "![Save main](../static/images/box-plot/save-main.png)"
    - copy: "Select your PLOT and DATA as 'Public' or 'Private'."
      img: "![Save pop-up](../static/images/box-plot/save-pop-up.png)"
    - copy: "For more information on how to save, export, and share, visit [this](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/) page!"
