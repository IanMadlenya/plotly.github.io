steps: 
 - title: Try an Example
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "A line graph is a quick and simple way to organize data, especially when comparing fewer than 25 numbers."
    - copy: "After selecting 'Line plot' under 'Chart Type', you can check out an example before adding your own data. Clicking the 'try an example' button will show what a sample chart looks like after adding data and playing with the style. You'll also see what labels were selected for this specific chart, as well as the end result."

 - title: Add Your Data to Plotly
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Head to Plotly’s new online [workspace](https://plot.ly/alpha/workspace/) and add your data. You have the option of typing directly in the grid, uploading your file, or entering a URL of an online dataset. Plotly accepts .xls, .xlsx, or .csv files. For more information on how to enter your data, see [this](http://help.plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/) tutorial."

 - title: Create Your Chart
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "After adding your own data, choose your 'Chart Type' in the GRAPH section on the left-hand side and select 'Line plot'."
      img: "![Choose chart main](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/choose-chart-main.png)"
    - copy: "Click on GRAPH on the left-hand side to add your Y- axis and X-axis to your line plot. After selecting ‘Line plot', you're then presented the y-axis and x-axis as shown in the figure below to create the plot."
      img: "![Adding x and y axis](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/line-axes-panel.png)"
    - copy: "This will create a raw line plot, as seen below."

      img: "![Type directly title](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/line-type-title-directly.png)"
    - copy: "The same can be done for the axis labels, and legend."
      img: "![Type directly axis](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/line-type-directly-axis.png)"
