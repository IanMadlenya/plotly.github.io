steps: 
 - title: Try an Example
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "A scatter plot uses Cartesian coordinates that displays values for typically two variables for a set of data."
    - copy: "After selecting 'Scatter plot' under 'Chart Type', you can check out an example before adding your own data. Clicking the 'try an example' button will show what a sample chart looks like after adding data and playing with the style. You'll also see what labels were selected for this specific chart, as well as the end result."

 - title: Add Your Data to Plotly
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Head to Plotly’s new online [workspace](https://plot.ly/alpha/workspace/) and add your data. You have the option of typing directly in the grid, uploading your file, or entering a URL of an online dataset. Plotly accepts .xls, .xlsx, or .csv files. For more information on how to enter your data, see [this](http://help.plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/) tutorial."

 - title: Create a Chart
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "After adding your own data, choose your 'Chart Type' in the GRAPH section on the left-hand side and select 'Scatter plot'."
      img: "![Choose chart main](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/scatter-choose-chart.png)"
    - copy: "Click on GRAPH on the left-hand side to add your Y- axis and X-axis to your line plot. After selecting ‘Scatter plot', you're then presented the y-axis and x-axis as shown in the figure below to create the plot."
      img: "![Adding x and y axis](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/scatter-adding-values.png)"
    - copy: "This will create a raw scatter plot, as seen below."
      img: "![Raw chart](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/scatter-raw-plot.png)"

 - title: Style a Chart
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "You can choose your colours, text position, or typeface. Click on STYLE on the left-hand side to play around with the style of your plot."
    - copy: "To change the colours, click on ‘Traces’ under the same STYLE tab. Note that certain colours and typeface are available only on PRO. Click [here](https://plot.ly/products/cloud/) to upgrade!"
      img: "![Colour main](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/scatter-colour-panel.png)"
    - copy: "For plots that have a larger data set with more values, you may want to display each group in different colours. This option is not currently available, but is coming soon!"
    - copy: "To add a title to your plot, you can type it directly on the title by double-clicking it."
      img: "![Type directly title](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/scatter-type-title-directly.png)"
    - copy: "The same can be done for the axis labels, and legend."
      img: "![Type directly axis](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/scatter-type-axis-directly.png)"
    - copy: "Another option is to visit the 'Traces' section under STYLE, click on 'Text' and enter your title in the box, as shown below."
      img: "![Type in layout panel](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/scatter-type-title-panel.png)"

 - title: Save and Share
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Your plot is now done! Click SAVE on the left-hand side, and give your file a name."
      img: "![Save main](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/scatter-save-main.png)"
    - copy: "Select your PLOT and DATA as 'Public' or 'Private'."
      img: "![Save pop-up](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/scatter-save-pop-up.png)"
    - copy: "For more information on how to save, export, and share, visit [this](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/) page!"
