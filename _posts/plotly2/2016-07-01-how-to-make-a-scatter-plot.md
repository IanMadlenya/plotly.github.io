 - title: Try an Example

    - copy: "Scatter plots graph the relationship between two variables."
    - copy: "After selecting 'Scatter plot' under 'Chart Type', you can check out an example before adding your own data. Clicking the 'try an example' button will show what a sample chart looks like after you add data and adjust the styles. In addition to seeing the end result, you will see which labels and style attributes were selected for this specific chart."

 - title: Add Your Data to Plotly
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Head to Plotly’s new online [workspace](https://plot.ly/alpha/workspace/) and add your data. You have the option of typing directly in the grid, uploading your file, or entering a URL of an online dataset. Plotly accepts .xls, .xlsx, or .csv files. For more information on how to enter your data, see [this](http://help.plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/) tutorial."

    - copy: "This will create a raw scatter plot, as seen below."

 - title: Style a Chart
   sub-steps:

    - copy: "To add a title to your plot, double click on the title and type directly into the field."
      img: "![Type directly title](../static/images/line-graph-and-scatter-plot-with-excel/scatter-type-title-directly.png)"
    - copy: "The same can be done for the axis labels and legend."
