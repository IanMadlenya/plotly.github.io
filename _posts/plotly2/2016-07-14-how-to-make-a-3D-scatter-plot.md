steps:
 - title: Try an Example
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "A 3D scatter plot graphs the data values of three variables against each other on the x, y, and z axes."
    - copy: "After selecting '3D Scatter' under 'Chart Type', you can check out an example before adding your own data. Clicking the 'try an example' button will show what a sample chart looks like after you add data and adjust the styles. In addition to seeing the end result, you will see which labels and style attributes were selected for this specific chart."

    - copy: "You can also use the data featured in this tutorial by clicking on 'Open This Data in Plotly' on the left-hand side. It will open in your workspace."
      img: "![Open data](../static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/open-this-data.png)"

 - title: Add Your Data to Plotly
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Head to Plotly’s new online data visualization [workspace](https://plot.ly/alpha/workspace/) and add your data. You have the option of typing directly in the grid, uploading your file, or entering the URL of an online dataset. Plotly accepts .xls, .xlsx, or .csv files. For more information on how to enter your data, see [this](http://help.plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/) tutorial."

 - title: Create a Chart
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "After adding your own data, go to GRAPH on the left-hand side, then 'Create'. Choose '3D Scatter' under 'Chart type'."
      img: "![Choose chart main](../static/images/scatter-plot-3D/3D-scatter-chart-type.png)"
    - copy: "Click on GRAPH on the left-hand side to add your values to your graph. After selecting ‘3D Scatter', fill in the X, Y, and Z dropdowns to create the plot."
      img: "![Values dropdown](../static/images/scatter-plot-3D/3D-scatter-XYZ-values.png)"
    - copy: "This will create a raw 3D scatter plot as seen below."

 - title: Style a Chart
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "You can choose your color, text position, or typeface. Click on STYLE on the left-hand side to adjust the style of your plot."
    - copy: "To change the color of the points, click on ‘Traces’ under the same STYLE tab, and choose your desired color. Additionally, this section allows you to change the diameter of the points and also the symbol. Note that certain colors and typefaces are only available with a PRO subscription.

    - copy: "To add a title to your graph, double click on the title and type directly into the field. The same can be done for the legend."
      img: "![Type directly title](../static/images/scatter-plot-3D/3D-scatter-type-title.png)"
    - copy: "Another option is to visit the 'Layout' section under STYLE, click on 'Text' and enter your title in the box, as shown below."
      img: "![Type in layout panel](../static/images/scatter-plot-3D/3D-Scatter-title-panel.png)"
    - copy: "To add axes labels, the 'Text' box is found in the 'Axes' section under STYLE. Note that you have to click on each X, Y, and Z text box to add its own label."

 - title: Save and Share
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Your plot is now done! Click SAVE on the left-hand side."
      img: "![Save main](../static/images/scatter-plot-3D/3D-scatter-plot-save.png)"
    - copy: "Give your file a name, then select your PLOT and DATA as 'Public' or 'Private'. For more information on how sharing works, including the difference between private, public and secret sharing, visit [this](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/) page."
