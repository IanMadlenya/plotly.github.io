 - title: Add Your Data to Plotly
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Head to Plotly’s Workspace and add your data. You have the option of typing directly in the grid, uploading your file, or entering a URL of an online dataset. Plotly accepts .xls, .xlsx, or .csv files. For more information on how to enter your data, see [this](http://help.plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/) tutorial."
      img: "![Import data main](../static/images/create-pie-chart/import-data-main.png)"
    - copy: "After selecting your 'Pie chart' under 'Chart Type', you can check out an example before adding your own data. Clicking the 'try an example' button will show what a sample chart looks like after adding data and playing with the style. You'll see what labels were selected for this specific chart, as well as the end result."

 - title: Create a Chart
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "After adding your own data, click on GRAPH on the left-hand side to add your 'Labels' and 'Values' to your pie chart. Slick on the ‘Pie chart' dropdown, then select the x and y axis as shown in the figure below to create the plot."
      img: "![Label main](../plotly.github.io/static/images/create-pie-chart/label-main.png)"
      img: "![Labels and values](../plotly.github.io/static/images/create-pie-chart/labels-and-values.png)"
    - copy: "This will create a raw pie chart, as seen below. It may not look perfect right away, but playing around with the style will get it there."
      img: "![Raw chart](../static/images/create-pie-chart/raw-chart-open-slices.png)"
 
 - title: Style a Chart
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "You can choose your colours, text position, or typeface. Click on STYLE on the left-hand side to play around with the style of your chart."
    - copy: "This particular chart has many values, so we've changed the text position from 'Outside Slices' to 'Hidden', creating a neater looking pie chart."
      img: "![Neater pie chart](../static/images/create-pie-chart/neater-chart-hidden-slices.png)"
    - copy: "To change the colours, click on ‘Traces’ under the same STYLE tab. Note that certain colours and typeface are available only on PRO. Click [here](https://plot.ly/products/cloud/) to upgrade!"
      img: "![Colour main](../static/images/create-pie-chart/colour-main.png)"
    - copy: "You can also take your pie chart to the next level by pulling apart your pie slices, or by creating a donut chart."
    - copy: "You'll be able to do both by visiting 'Traces' in the STYLE section. For pulling your pie slices apart, play with the percentage in the PULL APART % field under 'Modify'."
      img: "![Pull apart](../static/images/create-pie-chart/pull-apart.png)"
    - copy: "If you wish to create a donut chart, you can play around with the % in the HOLE field."
      img: "![Hole](../static/images/create-pie-chart/hole.png)"

 - title: Save and Share
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Click SAVE on the left-hand side, and give your file a name."
      img: "![Save main](../static/images/create-pie-chart/save-main.png)"
    - copy: "Select your PLOT and DATA as 'Public' or 'Private'."
      img: "![Save pop-up](../static/images/create-pie-chart/save-pop-up.png)"
