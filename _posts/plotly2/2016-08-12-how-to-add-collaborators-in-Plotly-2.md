otherlang: Know how to program? Learn about [collaborating with our APIs](https://plot.ly/ipython-notebooks/collaboration/), including Python, R, and Matlab.

steps: 
 - title: Introduction
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Whether you're at Plotly to create graphs for school, business, or for fun, you can [share and export](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/) these graphs so your colleagues and friends can see your work."
    - copy: "Additionally, you can add collaborators to your charts."
    - copy: "Who are collaborators and why would you add them? First of all, they're Plotly users, so they have to [sign up](http://help.plot.ly/how-to-sign-up-to-plotly/) if they don't already have an account. Collaborators are usually people you work with, and they can edit your plot as well as your data."

 - title: Add Collaborators to Plot
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "After you've [plotted](http://help.plot.ly/tutorials/#basic), [styled](http://help.plot.ly/style-your-plots/) and [saved](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/) your graph, you can start adding collaborators."
    - copy: "Click on SHARE on the left-hand side of your [workspace](https://plot.ly/alpha/workspace/)."
      img: "![Collab Share](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/Screen Shot 2016-09-12 at 8.40.38 PM.png)"
    - copy: "When the 'Share' pop-up appears, click on the 'Collaborators' tab at the top. Enter their Plotly username or email address in the first field and click ADD. You also have the option of adding a message, but you need to select 'Notify via email'."
      img: "![Invite people](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/adding collaborators.png)"
    - copy: "Once you've added their information, their username or email address will appear under 'Current Collaborators'. If ever you want to remove them as collaborators, click on the 'x' next to their name."
      img: "![Current collaborators](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/Current Collabs.png)"
    - copy: "The other way to add collaborators is by going directly to your [list of files](https://plot.ly/organize/home) and bookmarking the page. This is where your saved plots and data are kept, so this is a good place to visit if you wish to share an older plot."
    - copy: "You can also find this page by going back to your [workspace](https://plot.ly/alpha/workspace/) and going to the SHARE tab, then clicking on 'Collaborators'. It's the blue 'list of files' hyperlink."
      img: "![List of files](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/listoffiles.png)"
    - copy: "To see how to add collaborators from this page, keep reading!"  

 - title: Add Collaborators to Grid
   sub-steps:   
    - copy: "Remember, collaborators can edit your data and your plot. This means they can edit the grid and also change the [style](http://help.plot.ly/style-your-plots/) of your chart, add [annotations](http://help.plot.ly/how-to-add-annotations/) and/or [logos](http://help.plot.ly/logos/). In order for them to edit your entire plot, you must add the collaborator on both the plot and the associated data grid." 
    - copy: "To add collaborators to your grid, go to your [list of files](https://plot.ly/organize/home). Hover over your grid thumbnail, then click on the 'Share' icon. You can also share a plot this way!"
      img: "![Organize page](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/organize page.png)"
    - copy: "Once the pop-up appears, add their username or email address and click ADD."

 - title: As a Collaborator
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Time to switch places! Let's look at it from the collaborator's side."
    - copy: "If the creator of the plot has opted to notify you by via email, you'll receive one, stating that they want to share a plot with you and wish to collaborate. You'll be given a link of where you can view the plot (called the 'Shareplot' page). You can click on 'Fork & Edit' to edit the plot."
      img: "![Fork and edit](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/fork and edit.png)"
    - copy: "Otherwise, shared plots and grids can be viewed in the same ['Organize'](https://plot.ly/organize/home) page, then by clicking on 'Shared with me' on the left-hand side."
      img: "![Shared Files](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/sharewithme.png)"
    - copy: "The plot and/or grid will be listed as thumbnails, and you'll have to hover over one and click on EDIT IN 2.0."
      img: "![Hover thumbnail](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/hover-thumbnail.png)"
    - copy: "You'll be taken to the [workspace](https://plot.ly/alpha/workspace/) and as you can see, it looks exactly like it did when it was saved and shared. Now it's your turn to work on it!"
      img: "![Hover thumbnail](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/collab on workspace.png)"
    - copy: "Looks like you've [added another trace](http://help.plot.ly/make-a-line-graph-or-scatter-plot/#step-3-create-a-chart) and [styled](http://help.plot.ly/style-your-plots/) the graph. It looks pretty cool, so now you're now ready to save! There's no need to rename the file."
      img: "![New plot](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/save new plot.png)"
    - copy: "The creator of the plot will go back to their [list of files](https://plot.ly/organize/home) and see that the plot was updated."
      img: "![New plot](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/after collab.png)"   
      
 - title: Helpful Reminders
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "If you have a PRO account and have created a chart, or used features that are only available with a PRO subscription, but are collaborating with someone who has a Community account, they won't be able to save the plot."
    - copy: "You can save your plots as private or public. If you set your plot as private, no one will be able to view it, only your collaborators will be able to view and edit your plot."
    - copy: "For an easier way to keep your files organized, and to keep track of your plots and their associated grids, we highly recommend that you name your plot and grid when you [save them](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/)."
    - copy: "We understand that sharing your data and plots can make a few people nervous. For more information on how sharing works, click [here](http://help.plot.ly/how-sharing-works-in-plotly/)."
