steps: 
 - title: Your Collaborators
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Whether you're at Plotly to create graphs for school or business (or for fun!), you can [share and export](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/) these graphs so your colleagues and friends can see your work."
    - copy: "Additionally, you can add Collaborators to your charts."
    - copy: "Who are collaborators and why would you add them? First of all, they're Plotly users, so they have to [sign up](http://help.plot.ly/how-to-sign-up-to-plotly/) if they don't already have an account. Collaborators, usually your work partners, can edit your plot as well as your data."

 - title: Add from Your Workspace
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "After you've [plotted](http://help.plot.ly/tutorials/#basic), [styled](http://help.plot.ly/style-your-plots/) and [saved](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/) your graph, you can start adding collaborators."
    - copy: "Click on SHARE on the left-hand side of your [workspace](https://plot.ly/alpha/workspace/)."
      img: "![Collab Share](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/Screen Shot 2016-09-12 at 8.40.38 PM.png)"
    - copy: "When the 'Share' pop-up appears, click on the 'Collaborators' tab at the top. Enter their Plotly username or email address in the first field and click ADD. You also have the option of adding a message, but you need to select 'Notify via email'."
      img: "![Invite people](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/adding collaborators.png)"
    - copy: "Once you've added their information, their username or email address will appear under 'Current Collaborators'. If ever you want to remove them as Collaborators, click on the 'x' next to their name."
      img: "![Current collaborators](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/Current Collabs.png)"
    - copy: "Remember, Collaborators can edit your data and your plot. This means they can edit the grid and also change the [style](http://help.plot.ly/style-your-plots/) of your chart, add [annotations](http://help.plot.ly/how-to-add-annotations/) and/or [logos](http://help.plot.ly/logos/). In order for them to have access to and edit your entire plot, you must add the collaborator on both the plot and the associated data grid."  
    - copy: "To add collaborators to your grid, go to your ['Organize'](https://plot.ly/organize/home) page; this is where your saved plots and data are kept. Hover over your grid thumbnail, then click on the 'Share' icon."
      img: "![Organize page](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/organize page.png)"
    - copy: "Once the pop-up appears, add their username or email address and click ADD."

 - title: Add from Your Organize
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "The other way to add collaborators is by doing it from your ['Organize'](https://plot.ly/organize/home) page, the same way we mentioned earlier. This is if you want to share an older plot, or a grid as already described."
    - copy: "One way of getting there is by visiting this [this page](https://plot.ly/organize/home) and bookmarking it."
    - copy: "The other way is by the SHARE tab in your [workspace](https://plot.ly/alpha/workspace/) we mentioned earlier, and clicking on 'Collaborators'. Then click on the blue 'list of files' hyperlink."
      img: "![List of files](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/listoffiles.png)"
    - copy: ""

 - title: Being a Collaborator
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "If you've opted to notify them via email, they'll receive one, stating that you want to share a plot with them and wish to collaborate. They'll be given a link of where they can view the plot (called the 'Shareplot' page). They'll then have to click on 'Fork & Edit' to edit the plot."
      img: "![Fork and edit](../)"
    - copy: "Otherwise, shared plots and grids can be viewed in the same ['Organize'](https://plot.ly/organize/home) page, and then by clicking on 'Shared with me' on the left-hand side."
      img: "![Shared Files](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/sharewithme.png)"
    - copy: "The plot and/or grid will be listed as thumbnails, and your collaborator(s) will have to hover over them and click on EDIT IN 2.0. They'll then be taken to the [workspace](https://plot.ly/alpha/workspace/)."
      img: "![Hover thumbnail](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/hover thumbnail.png)"
      
 - title: Helpful Reminders
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "If you have a PRO account and have created a chart or used features that are available only with a PRO subscription, but want to collaborate with someone who has a Community account, they won't be able to save the plot."
    - copy: "For an easier way to keep your files organized, and to keep track of your plots and their associated grids, we highly recommend that you name your plot and grid when you [save them](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/)."
    - copy: "We understand that sharing your data and plots can make a few people nervous. For more information on how sharing works, click [here](http://help.plot.ly/how-sharing-works-in-plotly/)."
