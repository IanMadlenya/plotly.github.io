steps: 
 - title: Your Collaborators
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Whether you're at Plotly to create graphs for school or business (or for fun!), you can [share and export](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/) these graphs so not only your colleagues and friends can see your work."
    - copy: "Additionally, you can create collaborators to charts, either through your online [workspace](https://plot.ly/alpha/workspace/), or by adding collaborators to your datasets in your [list of files](https://plot.ly/organize/home), also called your 'Organize' page."
    - copy: "Who are collaborators and why would you add them? First of all, they're Plotly users, so they have to [sign up](http://help.plot.ly/how-to-sign-up-to-plotly/) if they don't already have an account. Collaborators, usually your work partners, can edit your plot as well as your data."

 - title: Add from Your Workspace
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "After you've [plotted](http://help.plot.ly/tutorials/#basic), [styled](http://help.plot.ly/style-your-plots/) and [saved](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/) your graph, you can start adding collaborators."
    - copy: "Click on SHARE on the left-hand side of your workspace."

    - copy: "When the 'Share' pop-up appears, click on the 'Collaborators' tab at the top. Enter their Plotly username or email address in the first field and click ADD. You also have the option of adding a message, but you need to select 'Notify via email'."
      img: "![Invite people](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/adding collaborators.png)"
    - copy: "Once you've added their information, their username or email address will appear under 'Current Collaborators'. If ever you want to remove them as Collaborators, click on the 'x' next to their name."
      img: "![Current collaborators](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/Current Collabs.png)"
    - copy: "Remember, Collaborators can edit your data and your plot. This means they can work on the grid and also change the [style](http://help.plot.ly/style-your-plots/) of your chart, add [annotations](http://help.plot.ly/how-to-add-annotations/) and/or [logos](http://help.plot.ly/logos/). In order for them to have access to your entire plot, you must add the collaborator on both the plot and the associated data grid."  
    - copy: "To add collaborators to your grid, go to your ['Organize'](https://plot.ly/organize/home) page, and hover over your grid thumbnail. Click on the 'Share' icon."
      img: "![Organize page](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/organize to share.png)"
    - copy: "Once the pop-up appears, add their username or email address and click ADD."
      img: "![Adding grid collabs](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/adding collabs to grid.png)"
    
    - copy: "They'll receive an email, stating that you want shared a plot with them and want to collaborate, with a link of where they can view the plot (called the 'Shareplot' page). They'll then have to click on 'Fork & Edit' to edit the plot."
      img: "![Fork and edit](../)"
    - copy: "Otherwise, you can visit your "My files" section under "Shared files"
      img: "![Shared Files](../static/images/misc-tutorial-images/shared with me.png)"

 - title: Add from Your Organize
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "The other way to add collaborators is by doing it from your ['Organize'](https://plot.ly/organize/home) page. This is where your saved plots and data are kept."
    - copy: "One way of getting there is by the SHARE tab we mentioned earlier, and clicking on 'Collaborators'. Then click on the blue 'list of files' hyperlink."
      img: "![List of files](../)"
    - copy: "This will bring you to . "  
      img: "![](../)"
 
 - title: Sharing
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "We understand that sharing your data and plots can make a few people nervous."
    - copy: "For more information on how sharing work, click [here](http://help.plot.ly/how-sharing-works-in-plotly/)."
