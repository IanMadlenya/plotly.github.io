Plotly can create interactive satellite maps with Mapbox. 

By default, these maps are downloaded from the public Mapbox API. If you are using [Plotly On-Premise](https://plot.ly/product/enterprise/) you will need to license an account from Mapbox Studio or license a private Mapbox Atlas server.

Connecting Mapbox Atlas to Plotly is currently a beta feature. If you would like to run these products together, please reach out to our support team at <support@plot.ly>. You will need to configure your Mapbox Atlas server and your Plotly On-Premise with custom settings.
