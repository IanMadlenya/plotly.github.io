steps:
 - title: Download and Install the Plotly Database Connector App
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Please note that SQLite currently is supported on Mac OS only. Linux and Windows support will come shortly. Thank you for your patience."
    - copy: "Simply [Download](https://github.com/plotly/electron-sql-connector/releases) the app to get started!"
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/all/download-app.png)"
 - title: Launch and Connect
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Having launched the app, select SQlite by clicking on its icon."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/sqlite/sqlite-connect.png)"
    - copy: "Click on the *path to database* input field and a dialog window will open. Navigate to your local database file (having a *.db* extension). If your data is in csv format, convert it first to a database *.db* file."
    - copy: "The dialog menu will only allow you to select a database *.db* file."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/sqlite/file.png)"
    - copy: "Finally, click on the *connect* button!"
 - title: Choose A Database
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Once connected, a dropdown menu will appear. When using sqlite, the *.db* file itself is the one and only database which will contain one or many tables. Thus the database dropdown menu will be greyed out since there are no choices of databases. Your connection to it is established and the preview of each table are displayed."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/sqlite/database-selector.png)"
 - title: Preview Your Tables
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "A dropdown menu will appear. The options are the tables of the database previously selected. Select the table you wish to preview (see the top 5 rows of the table)."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/all/preview-1.png)"
    - copy: "Scroll down to to see the full table if it does not fit in the preview window."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/all/preview-2.png)"
 - title: Send a Query to Your Database
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Having connected your app, visit [plot.ly](https://plot.ly/alpha/workspace/) workspace and click on *import data* in the top right corner."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/import-data/import-data.png)"
    - copy: "Choose *SQL* from the options on the left."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/import-data/choose-sql.png)"
    - copy: "A connection endpoint will be suggested. By default, the connector runs on http://localhost:5000. To use that default endpoint you will have to let your browser use *unsafe scripts* (the above endpoint uses http protocol instead of https). To do so simply keep reading the following steps. If your data is highly sensitive, you can setup your Plotly Database Connector to use the more secure https protocol to transfer data. If you are on Mac or Linux, follow instructions on Step 3 of your Plotly Database Connector. Https support for Windows is shortcoming, thank you for your patience."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/import-data/endpoint.png)"
    - copy: "If you chose to pursue using the http protocol, simply keep the endpoint as default http://localhost:5000 and click on *connect*."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/import-data/connect.png)"      
    - copy: "You should receive an error. Make sure your browser's *safe scripting* setting is turned off. Click on the icon inside your search bar to disable it (a shield icon if you are using the Chrome browser (recommended))."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/import-data/http-error.png)"
    - copy: "Once connected, you will see an SQL editor along with a database dropdown menu. Select the database from the dropdown menu to connect to that database. In this example, let's use *plotly_datasets*."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/import-data/select-database.png)"
    - copy: "Having selected a database from the dropdown menu, a query will appear on the first line of the editor. Modify it until you are satisfied with the data that you are querying from your database. For this example, let's quickly import all of the data from the agricultural imports table *us_ag_exports_2011*. Enter the query *SELECT * FROM us_ag_exports_2011*. Where * is a SQL keyword for 'all'."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/import-data/query-statement.png)"
    - copy: "To execute the query, click on *RUN QUERY* button."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/import-data/query-run.png)"
    - copy: "Your data will be imported into the grid below. You can now create a plot using the imported data from your SQL database."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/import-data/data.png)"
 - title: Making a plot!
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Let's visualize the beef exports by state on a map. On the left side, the *GRAPH* tab should be selected. Here you can choose the *Chart Type* drop down menu. Choose *Choropleth*. As for *Locations*, choose the *state* column. Finally, set the *Values* to be the *beef* column."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/import-data/graph-1.png)"
    - copy: "Since our *code* column data is in three letter state codes, select the *Location Format* to be *USA State Abbreviations*. We are only looking at USA data here, so for the *Map Region* option select *USA*. Finally, let's keep it simple and keep the *Projection* option as the default *Albers USA*. Come back later to explore more options."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/import-data/graph-2.png)"
    - copy: "Look to the right! You graph should be already updated. Why not add a title? Click into the empty field above the graph and enter a description."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/import-data/graph-3.png)"
    - copy: "Let's not lose all this work! Let's save the graph. Click on the *SAVE* tab on the left."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/import-data/graph-save.png)"
    - copy: "You will be prompted to choose your privacy settings for this graph and data. There is nothing here to classify, let's simply set both *plot* and *data* to *public*. Click *SAVE*."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/import-data/graph-save-modal.png)"
    - copy: "Let's share this interactive plot with a friend or a coworker (or both)! Click on the *SHARE* tab on the left."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/import-data/graph-share.png)"
    - copy: "The fastest way is to send the *Shareable Link*, copy and paste it into your favorite e-mail or other communication service. Try out our Twitter, Facebook and Google+ links as well or embed it into your website by obtaining the iframe link in the *Embed* tab. If you set the settings to *public* previously, your friend or coworker will be able to view it even without an account and give you feedback."
      img: "![](/static/images/database-connectors/import-data/graph-share-modal.png)"
 - title: Disconnect
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "When your are finished creating graphs using the data from your database, disconnect by moving your mouse onto the *Connected* button in the Plotly Database Connector and click when it says *Disconnect*."
