    - copy: "Click on the *path to database* input field and a dialog window will open. Navigate to your local database file (having a *.db* extension). If your data is in csv format, convert it first to a database *.db* file."

Thus the database dropdown menu will be greyed out since there are no choices of databases. Your connection to it is established and the preview of each table are displayed."
