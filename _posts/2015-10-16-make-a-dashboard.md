### Step 5 - Style your dashboard! 

In this particular dashboard, we have six graphs; organizing them in rows of two looks the least cluttered.

### Step 6 - Add Links to Navigation Bar

As you are editing your dashboard, click settings in the upper right. This will give you the opportunity to adjust your navigation links at the upper left of the dashboard. Relevant links can add value to the dashaboard.
