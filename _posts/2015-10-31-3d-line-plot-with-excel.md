This step by step tutorial will help you create your own 3D Line Plots.

**Sections:** Upload, Create, Decorate and Deploy

**Pre-requisite:** Download the <a class="link--impt" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/volcano.csv" target="_blank">
sample data file</a> required for the plot onto your local system.

### Upload - Your data to Plotly's grid

Head to Plotly's Workspace at <a class="link--impt" href="/plot">https://plot.ly/plot</a> and sign into your free Plotly account.

Click "Add data" button on Workspace Menu bar. Choose the data file to upload. Your Excel file will now open in Plotly's grid. For more about Plotly's grid, see the tutorial: <a class="link--impt" href="/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/">https://plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/</a>

### Create the 3D Plot

Select “3D Line Plot” from the `MAKE A PLOT` button on menu bar.

Select the columns to be used as x,y and z axes for line plot.

Click on '3d line plot' button to generate the plot.

### Decorate - The created Line Plot

We will now add some style elements to the generated plot.

Styling options are present on the left side of the plot.

**Change Background color**:

  1. Click on the "Axis" selector on the options menu on the left side of the plot
  2. Click on the "Lines" tab from the pop-up.
  3. Set "Background" to "On"
  4. Select background color from the color pallete.

**Stylize Axes**:

Go to "Lines" tab from "Axis" Selector:

  1. Set Grid Lines to "On". Select rgb(255,255,255),i.e. white color from pop-up.
  2. Set Zero Lines to "On". Select rgb(255,255,255),i.e. white color from pop-up.

### Deploy - Your 3D Line Plot

After Adding the styling, the plot will look something like this:

Now you can share the generated plot with your peers/collaborators (basically, anyone you want to!)

Click on share button on left menu bar:

You can share it as a web-link, embed in your website(as an iframe), or share it via popular social networking sites. Cool, huh!
