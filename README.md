# Contributing
Tutorials are written as individual .md files. The tutorials are organized in folders (by subject) in the `/_post` folder: https://github.com/plotly/plotly.github.io/tree/master/_posts.
To create a new tutorial, create a new .md file in the appropriate folder for the tutorial (i.e. if the tutorial is for a feature of [Plotly's workspace](https://plot.ly/create/) add your .md file to the [plotly2 folder](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.github.io/tree/master/_posts/plotly2)).
The title of your .md file **must** include the date (date created): `yyyy-mm-dd-title-of-tutorial.md`.
